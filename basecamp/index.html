<!--[ ] Mimic the top bar. Include the three links and their explanatory
text, each centered in its own (invisible) bounding box.
[ ] Mimic the layout of the header ("Last Week..."), the customer
testimonial (with a picture and text), and signup form. (It's ok if
your sections don't look like the real version, but you should make
sure they're in the right place.)
